## Project Description
I've been assigned the task of analyzing a series of FOREX operations that a trading system designed by Ram√≥n Rosa Augusto deemed as profitable to study an observed tendency change to determine if it is significant. Furthermore, I will analyze its time dependence and try to find strengths and weaknesses that allow us to optimize the system's performance.

## Questions & Hypotheses
There are two main questions we aim to solve with this analysis:

    - Is the tendency change observed in the last period of operations significant, or is an expected deviation given the statistical nature of the system?
    - Are there any patterns when we analyze the system over time and can we use them to optimize our system's performance?

## Dataset
Our data consists on a series of operations where the profit per unit invested and the date has been recorded. The dates range from February 2018 to April 2021.

## Organization
I used a Trello board to organize my schedule and separate every task so I can easily keep track of them. Jupyter Notebook was used for the data cleaning and hypothesis testing and Tableau was used to create visualizations and use them for our analysis.

My repository includes the following files:

    - README document
    - 'Technical Report.pdf' (a technical report of my analysis of the data)
    - 'Data Analysis.ipynb' (a Jupyter Notebook file containing all the cleaning data routines and all the calculations performed with our data for our analysis)
    - FOLDER 'data'
        - 'data.xlsx' (the original data file)
        - 'data_cl.csv' (a file with data that has been cleaned and processed)
    - FOLDER 'Pictures'
        - A set of pictures used for the technical report and presentation
